Nomad's (https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad) docker driver doesn't support volumes.
There is someone that made a "wrapper" around nomad's raw_exec driver to give you volumes, but I didn't care for it.
I wanted a more generic solution
Their solution is here: https://gist.github.com/ketzacoatl/3ccf5bb822df51aed2b896641e931c8a#file-run-postgres
My solution is here.

It's generic, you define network just like always, you define volumes as META labels in your nomad job config.
It's working for me ... in beta.

an example job for the docker registry is included in registry.nomad.

to INSTALL (must do this on each docker host):
pip install docker-py
cp runNomadDocker.py /usr/local/bin

Then configure your job to run raw_exec and runNomadDocker.py as your command.
Config your mounts, network, image, etc via meta { } config block (details below).

nomad docker doesn't allow us to do volumes, which hurts.
This is a work-around.  I hope they add this soon.

all META keys are capitalized by NOMAD, so be sure to define your _LABELS as uppercase.

required keys:
IMAGE -- name of the docker image to pull.

optional:
NOMAD_META_REGISTRY_URL = the URL for the regitry to pull from, must include trailing /.

nomad do HOST export networking at all, so you have to specify it special in the env {} config.
NOMAD_META_NETWORK_LABELS = "" space seperated list of network labels.
NOMAD_PORT_<label> = '' IP port to expose inside the container.
NOMAD_IP_<label> = '' IP ADDRESS to expose.

NOMAD_HOST_PORT_<label> = '' IP port to expose on the host.

Currently only bind mounts are supported. here is how to do them:
NOMAD_META_VOLUME_LABELS="" is a space seperated list of volume labels (just like network labels)
NOMAD_META_SRC_<LABEL>=""  the source of the volume.
NOMAD_META_DST_<LABEL>="" the destination of the volume.
NOMAD_META_MODE_<LABEL>="" the mode (rw/ro) of the volume.  if missing defaults to rw.
